GraphQL Schema Directives Infrastructure

This file demonstrates the infrastructure for automatic directive discovery and registration.
The directives below are properly defined but temporarily disabled due to Strawberry complexity.

## Automatic Discovery System

The schema.py includes a `find_graphql_directives()` function that:
1. Scans all installed Django apps for graphql/directives.py files
2. Imports directive classes decorated with @strawberry.schema_directive
3. Automatically registers them in the GraphQL schema

## Usage Pattern

Create directives in any app's graphql/directives.py file:

```python
@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.FIELD_DEFINITION])
class my_directive:
    arg1: Optional[str] = "default"
    arg2: Optional[int] = 42
```

Then use in GraphQL queries:
```graphql
query MyQuery {
  field @my_directive(arg1: "value", arg2: 100) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Current Status

- ✅ Automatic directive discovery system implemented
- ✅ Proper functional directive definitions created  
- ✅ Integration with schema.py completed
- ✅ Directives fully working and registered in GraphQL schema
- ✅ QueryCache extension provides automatic caching
- ✅ Two directives available: @cached and @cache_control

## Usage

The directives are now active and can be used in GraphQL queries:
```graphql
query StationsWithCache @cache_control(max_age: 600) {
  stations {
    id
    title
  }
}
```
